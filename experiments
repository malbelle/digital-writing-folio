First Twine creation: 'Stop the Wedding!'
My first Twine experiment served as the catalyst for my final project, and allowed me to gain a basic understanding of html code. Twine's
straightforward function and visual map display assisted me greatly, allowing me to create a short second pov
story not entiely unlike my final project, in which you play a spurned ex-lover trying to interrupt your ex's wedding. 
During this experiment, I learnt how to insert images into Twine using GitHub desktop, and how to
change the font of my work. It was wonderfully gratifying to create something like this myself, no matter how simple; by the time I'd finished the work,
I was relieved to discover that I was not, in fact, quite as hopeless as I'd feared.

Glitch: We walk to you
My Glitch experiment was relatively successful, though I'll admit I didn't push the envelope as far I could've. I learnt to change the font and the adverbs,
which amused me greatly, allowing for combinations such as 'Jeff Bezos sashays to you,' but I wasn't able to push my sentences beyond this - though I did try to
edit the 'you' part (to no avail.) I also managed to change the background colour of the poem, resulting in what was undoubtedly a truly hideous, nonsensical creation. As entertaining
as I found this, I must confess that I found the limitations of its form to be frustrating. Perhaps, if I'd understood the code better, I could've remedied this.
