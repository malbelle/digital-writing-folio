<p><b>What do you think digital writing is?</b>
I believe digital writing incorporates digitlised media and format into a written piece, using techniques that would not be possible on pen and paper.</p>
<p><b>What do you expect from the digital writing lab?</b>
I expect to be taught the very basics of code in conjunction to digitlised formatting, and to be able to format my own pieces.</p>
<p><b>What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?</b>
I tend to almost exclusively write fiction, although I occasionally dabble in poetry.</p>
<p><b>What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?</b>
I like to use LifeAt, which enables you to set a writing mood through moving landscapes and atmospheric sounds.</p>
<p><b>Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?</b>
They help me to fully immerse myself within the writing experience and capture a mood.</p>
<p><b>How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?</b>
I think it enables me to be more experimental, to think in ways I might otherwise unconsciously avoid.</p>
