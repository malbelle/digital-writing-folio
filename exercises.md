<p><b>What do you think digital writing is?</b>
I believe digital writing incorporates digitlised media and format into a written piece, using techniques that would not be possible on pen and paper.</p>
<p><b>What do you expect from the digital writing lab?</b>
I expect to be taught the very basics of code in conjunction to digitlised formatting, and to be able to format my own pieces.</p>
<p><b>What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?</b>
I tend to almost exclusively write fiction, although I occasionally dabble in poetry.</p>
<p><b>What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?</b>
I like to use LifeAt, which enables you to set a writing mood through moving landscapes and atmospheric sounds.</p>
<p><b>Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?</b>
They help me to fully immerse myself within the writing experience and capture a mood.</p>
<p><b>How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?</b>
I think it enables me to be more experimental, to think in ways I might otherwise unconsciously avoid.</p>
<p><b>What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?</b>
There is a very deliberate use of space within these pieces, which enhances the experience of reading the piece. For example, 'The Gathering Cloud' fills the screen with images and text in order to overwhelm the viewer, and provide visualisation for the statistics give. Alterntaively, 'Taraoko Gorge' stagnates its text to mimic the layout of its titular environment.</p>
<p><b>How are those elements meaningful?</b>
These elements play an integral role in the construction of these works, as they shape the intereptation of the works and the way in which they are experienced. 'The Gathering Cloud' evolves from an informational text to a sensory experience that engages the audience through a collage of related images. This lends itself to an entirely different reading of the text that would not have been possible in printed text. In fact, the impact of the text would be lost in print.</p>
<p><b>How are the works read differently from print literature?</b>
Digital literature can utilise time-based techniques that ensure readers are given information when intended, guiding the experience in a way that would be impossible on paper.</p>
<p><b>How is electronic literature different from print literature?</b>
Print literature provides a reading experience that is very direct and instant, allowing the reader to take in the entirety of the text's layout in a single glance. It is able to convey only what is on the page, with no element of spontaneity.</p>
<p><b>What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?</b>
Imagery, timing and sound are qualities that are almost exclusive to digital literature, allowing for an experience that goes beyond ink and paper. This allows for text to take forms and convey meaning that engages senses other than mere sight.

<p><b>How is hypertext fiction different from fiction</b>
Hypertext fiction is a form of digital fiction. It allows for non-linearity through the use of hypertext links and encourages reader interaction. Regular fiction, however, does not typically employ the use of links and is typically more traditional in its use of linear storytelling. Hypertext also incorporates connections to other documents, while fiction does not.</p>
<p><b>How is it different from games?</b>
Hypertext fiction does not encourage the reader to make decisions or 'play,' unlike games. Rather, hypertext fiction is about exploration. It encourages readers to plumb the depths of the piece, and offers only a handful of limited options.</p>
<p><b>How do you plan fiction?</b>
I like to have an outline, like a chapter or scene summary. I tend to keep it brief, however, as I find that over-planning my work lessens my desire to actually produce it. I value a bit of spontaenity in my work.</p>
<p><b>How could you plan hypertext fiction?</b>
You could plan the documents connected to the initial one, and you could list the differing options and subsequent choices.</p>

What aspects of the remix are the same?</b>
The patterns of the work (short choppy sentences, small paragraphs, frequent cut offs mid-sentence) remain the same, even when the words themselves are different. Despite its copious remixes, the body and form of the poem continues to emulate its namesake, bringing to mind winding trails and rocky pathways.
<b>What aspects of the remix are different?</b>
The words themselves are replaced with synonyms or nouns that possess similiar connotations, or else shuffled around in different orders to produce unqiue sentences. As such, the terrain of the work differs in significant amounts, but its base structure, as previously mentioned, is ultimately retained.
</b>Is the remix successful (why or why not)?</b>
I suppose this depends on the poem's intent. As a remix, I find the changes to be near-indistinguishable in places, rendering them almost redundant. Alternatively, the changes both alter the gorge's landscape while maintaining its formulative elements, which is an achievement in and of itself. Ultimately, I believe that if ensuring the poem's integrity was the goal, the remix was indeed successful.
