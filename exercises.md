What do you think digital writing is?
I believe digital writing incorporates digitlised media and format into a written piece, using techniques that would not be possible on pen and paper.
What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to be taught the very basics of code in conjunction to digitlised formatting, and to be able to format my own pieces.
What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
I tend to almost exclusively write fiction, although I occasionally dabble in poetry.
What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I like to use LifeAt, which enables you to set a writing mood through moving landscapes and atmospheric sounds.
Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
They help me to fully immerse myself within the writing experience and capture a mood.
How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I think it enables me to be more experimental, to think in ways I might otherwise unconsciously avoid.
