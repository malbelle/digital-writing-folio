<b>THE CONCEPT</b>
Undertaking a video game format, my piece aims to ‘simulate’ the everyday experience of customer service through a series of dialogue-based interactions with varying archetypical customers. 
There will be four customers in total: the cranky old lady, the oversharer, the indecisive, and the patronizing old man. 
Each interaction is intended to test the player’s patience, with some customers even becoming increasingly irate and difficult to satisfy. 
As this happens, players will be presented with dialogue options that allow for argumentative responses. However, if these options are chosen, the player loses the game and is faced with a comically inaccurate Google review about their treatment of the customer.
In order to win the game, players must successfully serve each customer while resisting the inflammatory dialogue options. 
If the player is able to ‘keep their cool’ during each customer interaction, they will be presented with a screen congratulating them on their success.
Much like a video game, they will also be informed that they’ve levelled up and gained two new items in their inventory.
The items in question will be a bottle of cheap wine, and the player’s paycheck – but in a last-minute twist, the paycheck’s amount will be drained to accommodate the player’s rent for the month.


<b>THE PURPOSE</b>
My piece endeavors to juxtapose the mental taxation of customer service with the menial pay offered to workers in the industry. 
It will possess themes of triviality and powerlessness
Customer interactions are intended to both amuse and bewilder. 
Ultimately, it will confront the current cost-of-living crisis and the financial struggle of service workers.
