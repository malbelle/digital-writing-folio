Reflection:

This week I worked on my second customer and constructed a dialogue tree. 
I had a vague idea of where I wanted to go with it, but, as I hadn’t planned anything prior, I found the task daunting and struggled to complete this step of my work. 
It became quickly apparent to me that this approach would not allow for effective story-telling, and would likely lessen the quality of the two remaining customer interactions. 
As such, I’ve decided to sketch out a script beforehand and lay out the roadmaps to each line of dialogue in a word doc; I believe this will improve both my productivity and enjoyment.
