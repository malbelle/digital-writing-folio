The following observations have been recorded in a word document over the course of the semester:

WEEK 1
I'll admit it now upfront: I don't care much for coding. No, scratch that: I'm rather terrified of it. All those symbols and numbers might
as well be hierogylphics for all that I can discern them, and everytime I've been given leave to try in the past, the result has been a throbbing headache and
a twisting stomach. That same sensation plagued me this week as I sat down for my first class, dread sitting heavy in my stomach right alongside the two lukewarm
weetbix I'd had for breakfast. This feeling only intensified when my tutor showed the class examples of other people's creations: timed poems, animated sprites,
blinking text...it all seems so terribly beyond reach, and I can't quite shake the feeling that I'm in over my head. But I selected this class to gain useful industry
skills, and if I want to work in the digital age, I suppose I have to learn to be adaptable. We looked at three pieces this week: 'Taroko Gorge', 'The Gathering Cloud', and 'Shade.'
I'll confess, I didn't care much for any of them. I gave up on 'Shade' almost immeadiately, frustrated by my lack of progress, and I found 'The Gathering Cloud' to be
overstimulating and too-experimental for my taste. 'Taroko Gorge' was impressive with its use of timed poetry, but I didn't care much for the poems themselves,
and I struggled to follow along when my tutor broke down the inner-mechanics of it. With this in mind, I don't think I'll be attempting any of these for my own project.

WEEK 2
No class.

WEEK 3
This week, we prepared for our upcoming presentations on a chosen digital work. I'd taken the time last week to select my favourities from the archives given,
and I've found I tend to favour the more simplisitic pieces. No surprises there, I suppose. I also prefer the works that have clear narrative intention, much like
a traditionally written piece now. Needless to say, I'm not very fond of the more experimental, abstract pieces. As such, I've chosen Anna Antrophy's 'Hunt for
the Gay Planet,' a choose-your-own-adventure game written from the second-person perspective. Witty, satiricial and relatively easy to follow, I was drawn to this
piece by its snappy title, and the relevance it holds in my own life. Additionally, I found the idea of a choose-your-own-adventure format very appealing, and
and I'm already beginning to think up ways I can utilise it to create my own narrative. This week, we also had a go at formulating our own poems using a round-robin
of techniques, such as Daidaism and Lipograms. We were split into groups, and each group was able to experience two of the four offered techniques, which made
for some truly bewildering results. My own group attempted the N+7 and Lipogram techniques, neither of which I enjoyed very much. I found each technique
frustrating and overly elaborate, while the resulting poems were frustraingly nonsensical (if occasionally amusing.) To be completely honest, the entire
thing felt like a big waste of time, and I resolved to avoid employing these techniques in the future, should the opportunity arise.

WEEK 7
This week I had to address what I've been attempting to ignore since the beginning of the semester: the task of conceptualising my own digital piece.
From as young as grade three, it's been evident to me that I possess very lack for all things STEM; to say coding intimidates me would be a gross
understatement. To put it plainly, I've spent much of my life attempting to avoid anything that would require even a modicum of coding knowledge. During
digital technology classes in highschool, I'd spend class making the sprites look as unique as possible, or else otherwise draw surrepitiously in the margins
everytime my teacher's back was turned. Honestly, I've never had any interest in coding, and although I've assured that little will be required of me in this area,
I still find the notion of coding my own piece to be terribly daunting. I've already vetoed several intriguing narrative avenues out of the sheer certainty
that I would be incapable of incorporating my ideas into a digital setting. The only thing I know for certain is that I wish to use Twine, as it is the program
I am least intimidated by. What's more, I've even managed to change the font type and add a (grossly oversized) image into  previous Twine experiment, and so
I'm tentatively hopeful that with the right idea, I can produce an idea both entertaining and realistic.

WEEK 8
I’ve come up with an idea for my piece, which I'm titling: Customer Service Simulator. It will function much as 'Hunt for the Gay Planet' did,
in a choose-your-own-adventure type format. I've drawn inspiration from dating sims such as 'Dream Daddy,'
and will be using dialogue trees to guide players through interactions with four archetypical customers. My intention is to create something
both absurdly amusing and socially relevant, drawing on today's cost of living crisis and the universal impodence of real-life customers.
I've already begun production on my piece, utilising the prototype as the basis of my code. Primarily, much of the process follows that of a 
creative narrative, as each text box requires at least 3-4 lines of description and dialogue. I’ve been thoroughly enjoying this aspect of my project, 
as character interactions have always been one of my favourite things to write - and in this way, I’ve managed to incorporate a level of comfort into 
what is otherwise a daunting task. Thankfully, the coding itself is relatively sparse, with the only real challenge involving the inclusion of 
my hand-drawn images. Despite copying the code exactly from my tutor’s notes, I can’t seem to get my drawings to appear; this is worrying, 
as the artwork is an integral piece of the work. I will endeavour to try again when I get a chance.

WEEK 9
I have successfully begun incorporating images into my work! After hastily emailing my teacher in a panic, I discovered I'd simply been launching Twine
from a browser rather than from my github file - which I'd also forgotten to keep updating intimittently. Furthermore, I was ignorant to the importance of
uploading my pictures online before attempting to use them. Ordinarily, this would not be an issue, as any photo found on the internet would already be 'online.'
But because my images are hand-drawn, I've had to indivudally upload each picture to Flickr and then redownload them using Flickr's software. This was an unforeseen
obstacle, but one that, with a little extra time, is easily overcome. Another challenge has been the sheer magnitiude of images I've had to keep track of. As so many
of my pictures are almost identical, save for a change in expression or pose, it's been a struggle to ensure each image ends up in the correct box; more than once
I've had a customer openly beaming while supposedly chewing the player out. As such, I've taken to labelling each image in correspondence to their emotion and
customer number, ie. 'customer2angry.' Still, this system has made it hard to differentiate the images from each other, but it's the only one I can presently think of.
In terms of progress, I've completed all interactions pertaining to the first customer and am preparing to tackle the second. So far, I've experienced no other coding issues 
- which I undoubtedly have Twine, in all its straightforward glory, to thank for. This is also, admittedly, by own design; outside of the occasional italicised word,
I've avoided attmepting anything beyond the default.

WEEK 10
This week I worked on my second customer and third customers, constructing their dialogue trees and formulating each pathway. Initially, I struggled to complete
customer two's pathway - as, while I had a vague idea of where I wanted it to go, I hadn’t planned anything concrete. As such, I found myself unable to decide
on the outcome of each dialogue option, and so my pice remained in limbo for most of this week. By the time I finished customer two, I was so exhausted
and unwilling to repeat the process that I realised a change of strategy was in order. It became quickly apparent to me that this approach would not allow for effective story-telling, 
and would likely lessen the quality of the remaining interactions. As such, I decided to sketch out a script beforehand and lay out the roadmaps to each line of dialogue in a word doc. Unfortunately,
this, too, had it's drawbacks, for, without Twine's visual reference, I struggled to outline each opton in a way that made sense and could be read a glance. After a bit of trial-and-error,
I settled for a hybrid method: I outlined the basis of each dialogue option in a word doc, then switched to Twine to further flesh out and detail each corresponding pathway. I truly found
Twine's digital map to be integral to the construction of my piece, as it's overhead view of my piece has kept me from becoming overwhelmed.
It's also brought to my attention my preference for visual outlines over solely textual ones, which I was not wholly aware of until this project. I believe this will enable me to formulate
better plans in the future, ensuring less time is spent agonising over minute decisions.
