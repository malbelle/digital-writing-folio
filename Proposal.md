<b>THE CONCEPT</b>
Utilising a video game format, my piece endeavours to ‘simulate’ the everyday experience of customer service through a series of dialogue-based interactions with four archetypical customers. These customers will be: the cranky old lady, the oversharer, the indecisive, and the patronizing old man. 
Each interaction will aim to test the player’s patience, with some customers even becoming increasingly irate and difficult to satisfy. 
As this happens, players will be presented with dialogue options that allow for either paitient or argumentative responses. However, if the argumentative options are chosen, the player loses the game and is faced with a comically inaccurate Google review about their treatment of the customer.
In order to win the game, players must successfully serve each customer while resisting the inflammatory dialogue options. 
If the player is able to pass each customer, they will have 'won,' and will be presented with a screen congratulating them on their success.
Much like a video game, they will also be informed that they’ve gained two new items in their inventory.
These items will be a bottle of cheap wine, and the player’s paycheck – but in a last-minute twist, the paycheck’s amount will be drained to accommodate the player’s rent for the month.


<b>THE PURPOSE</b>
My piece endeavors to juxtapose the mental taxation of customer service with the menial pay offered to workers in the industry. 
- It will possess themes of triviality and powerlessness.
- Customer interactions are intended to both amuse and bewilder. 
- Ultimately, it will confront the current cost-of-living crisis and the financial struggle of service workers.
